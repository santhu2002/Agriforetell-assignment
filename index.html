            <h3>What is the URGENCY ?</h3>
            <p>This very important Krsna consciousness movement is meant to save human society from spiritual death. At
                present human society is being misled by leaders who are blind, for they do not know the aim and
                objective of human life, which is self-realization and the reestablishment of our lost relationship with
                the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the missing point. This Krsna consciousness movement is
                trying to enlighten human society in this important matter.</p>
            <p>If at least, ten percent of the population become Krishna consciousness, there is guaranteed peace in the
                world. Because ekas candra… We do not require many moons in the sky. Only one moon is sufficient to
                drive away the darkness. Varam eka guni putra na ca murkha-satair api. Canakya Pandita says, 'It is
                better to have a qualified son than to have hundreds of fools.' So the modern civilization is going on
                in that way, godless civilization. If some percentage of the civilized human beings become Krishna
                conscious, that will bring forth peace. Otherwise it is not possible. There is therefore a necessity."

        <div class="questions">
            <div class="question">
                <h1>What is our real identity ? <span class="sym">+</span></h1>
                <p class="ans">The question “Who am I?” has preoccupied both philosophers and academics alike for millennia. The ancient scriptural wisdom of India explains that the bodies we see with our eyes – white, black, Indian, European, Greek, Chinese – are temporary, external designations. The real person, the spirit soul, dwells within. It is not that we should claim “I have a soul”. In fact you are the soul. The real understanding is, “I am a soul and I have a body”. When the body dies, the soul continues to live and moves onto another destination.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h1>Are all beings spirit souls? What about plants, animal, insects, etc ?<span class="sym">+</span></h1>
                <p class="ans">If there is life, it is the symptom of the presence of a soul. When a soul is present, all living things undergo six changes: they are born, they grow, they endure for a while, they produce offspring, they dwindle and then they die. These six stages can be seen in plants, animals, insects and even microbes although the duration of each stage will differ. If these six stages are present it means there is the presence of a soul which is the cause of these changes. Once the soul leaves, the organism dies</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h1>What do you mean by ‘people are materially conditioned’ ?<span class="sym">+</span></h1>
                <p class="ans">As spirit souls, we originate from the spiritual sky – which one may consider to be heaven. We have fallen into the material world which is a temporary place, and we become conditioned by its laws (the modes of material nature). Therefore we forget who we really are. We then believe that we are these bodies and act to satisfy our senses. Since sense pleasure is temporary, we will always remain unsatisfied. We often attempt to increase our sense enjoyment more and more and in quite diverse ways. To think that we can achieve real happiness through the mind, body and senses is an illusion. One who does not know the difference between the material and spiritual realities is considered materially conditioned.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h1>Who is Krishna ? <span class="sym">+</span></h1>
                <p class="ans">God has many names, but God is one. When we refer to God as the “Supreme” Lord, then there can only be one “Supreme” or it renders the term meaningless. The analogy of the Sun can be used to explain this idea. The Sun in Spanish is called ‘sol’, in English is called ‘sun’ and in Swahili is called ‘jua’. However none of those languages can have any claim of proprietorship over the Sun. It is not the Spanish Sun any more than it belongs to the people of Africa; it is the same sun that shines everywhere. Similarly, God is one and he has different names. Krishna is the original name of God in Sanskrit, which means ‘The All Attractive One’. Nobody in any religion denies the all attractive nature of God.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h1>What do you mean by ‘Krishna consciousness’ ?<span class="sym">+</span></h1>
                <p class="ans">‘Krishna’ means God. We are all intimately connected with Him because He is our original father. But we have forgotten this connection. When we become interested in knowing “What is my connection with God? What is the aim of life?” then we are God conscious or Krishna conscious.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h1>Why do you chant “Hare Krishna” maha mantra ? <span class="sym">+</span></h1>
                <p class="ans">This is the mantra for liberation in this age. Mantra means spiritual sound vibration. Material sounds affect us on the material emotional, psychological and intellectual levels, and clutter our consciousness. Spiritual sound vibrations, in particular, this Maha-mantra (the greatest chant for deliverance in this age) connects with who you really are (the soul) and revives our dormant spiritual consciousness. It re-awakens the conditioned soul to his real identity. The mantra is not a sectarian chant belonging to a particular religion. It is a chant of names of God and can be chanted by anyone. It is a transcendental sound vibration that connects with the spirit soul; the soul cannot be Muslim, Hindu, Christian or Jew; the soul is simply what it is – pure spirit.</p>
